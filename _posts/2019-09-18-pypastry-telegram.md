In this event we will host two sprints:

- [PyPastry](https://github.com/datapastry/pypastry/), a machine learning framework
- A [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot, for our new [channel](https://t.me/py_sprints)

The **PyPastry** sprint will be lead by Doug, its author, and we will work on different issues:

- Add new features
- Improve the test suite
- Add typing
- Create packages
- Set up the CI
- Improve the documentation
- ...

For the **Telegram bot**, we will create a bot to help us with our new channel. Any idea is welcome,
but some of the things we can work on are:

- Implement a `/next-event` command, to get the link to the next scheduled event in `/_post`
- Implement a `/next-event-location` to get the geolocation of the event in `/_post`
- Implement a `/check-events` to check if there is a new event or any updates in `/_post` using git diff
- Implement a `/send-telegram-message` to be able to send a message to telegram (this will need a telegram API key)
- Implement CI to check for new events or updates to events and to send information to the telegram group
- Implement a NLP system able to identify spam, rude or abusive messages, commercial messages like job postings...
  and automatically block people in the channel posting those (this will need a telegram API key)
